# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Write the test first. Watch it fail. Write minimal code to pass.

**Core principle:** If you didn't watch the test fail, you don't know if it tests the right thing.

## When to Use

**Always:** New features, bug fixes, refactoring, behavior changes.

**Exceptions (ask user):** Throwaway prototypes, generated code, configuration files.

## The Iron Law

```
NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST
```

Write code before the test? Delete it. Start over.

- Don't keep it as "reference"
- Don't "adapt" it while writing tests
- Delete means delete

## Red-Green-Refactor

### RED — Write Failing Test

Write one minimal test showing what should happen.

```typescript
test('retries failed operations 3 times', async () => {
  let attempts = 0;
  const operation = () => {
    attempts++;
    if (attempts < 3) throw new Error('fail');
    return 'success';
  };

  const result = await retryOperation(operation);

  expect(result).toBe('success');
  expect(attempts).toBe(3);
});
```

Requirements: one behavior, clear name, real code (no mocks unless unavoidable).

### Verify RED — Watch It Fail

**MANDATORY. Never skip.**

Confirm: test fails (not errors), failure message is expected, fails because feature missing.

### GREEN — Minimal Code

Write simplest code to pass the test. Don't add features beyond the test.

```typescript
async function retryOperation<T>(fn: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    try { return await fn(); }
    catch (e) { if (i === 2) throw e; }
  }
  throw new Error('unreachable');
}
```

### Verify GREEN — Watch It Pass

**MANDATORY.** Confirm: test passes, other tests still pass, output pristine.

### REFACTOR — Clean Up

After green only: remove duplication, improve names, extract helpers. Keep tests green. Don't add behavior.

## Good Tests

| Quality | Good | Bad |
|---------|------|-----|
| **Minimal** | One thing. "and" in name? Split it. | `test('validates email and domain')` |
| **Clear** | Name describes behavior | `test('test1')` |
| **Real** | Demonstrates desired API | Tests mock not code |

## Example: Bug Fix

**Bug:** Empty email accepted

**RED:**
```typescript
test('rejects empty email', async () => {
  const result = await submitForm({ email: '' });
  expect(result.error).toBe('Email required');
});
```

**GREEN:**
```typescript
function submitForm(data: FormData) {
  if (!data.email?.trim()) return { error: 'Email required' };
  // ...
}
```

## Red Flags — STOP and Start Over

- Code before test
- Test passes immediately
- Can't explain why test failed
- Rationalizing "just this once"

**All of these mean: Delete code. Start over with TDD.**

## Verification Checklist

Before marking work complete:

- [ ] Every new function/method has a test
- [ ] Watched each test fail before implementing
- [ ] Wrote minimal code to pass each test
- [ ] All tests pass, output pristine
- [ ] Edge cases and errors covered

## When Stuck

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Don't know how to test | Write wished-for API. Write assertion first. |
| Test too complicated | Design too complicated. Simplify interface. |
| Must mock everything | Code too coupled. Use dependency injection. |

## Testing Anti-Patterns

When adding mocks or test utilities, see @testing-anti-patterns.md to avoid common pitfalls.
